    "## 3.1 What are Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are blocks of code assigned to a name. Whenever a function is called, the code that makes up the function is run. Once that finishes, the computer will continue from the line right after the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create (or *declare*) a function like this:\n",
    "```lua\n",
    "function greet()\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "This example function prints a out greeting. The `function` keyword tells Lua that the following code is going to be a function. We immediately follow it with the name of our new function (in this case, 'greet'). Just like when we use functions such as `print` or `math.abs`, the name in a function declaration is followed immediately by parenthesis. The name must follow all the same rules that variable names do (no spaces, can't start with a number, etc.). We'll worry about what's inside the parenthesis (in this case, nothing) a bit later. The `end` keyword on the last line of this example tells Lua that we are finished defining our function. Any code written after the `end` will not be part of our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using (also called 'calling') our `greet` function might look something like this:\n",
    "```lua\n",
    "a = 4 -- do some stuff\n",
    "greet() -- say hello\n",
    "b = a + 7 -- go back to doing stuff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer performs `a = 4`, then 'jumps' to the start of the code inside the `greet` function, executes that code, and finally the computer jumps back to where it was before and continues with `b = a + 17`. In this case, this is functionally identical to replacing the `greet()` with the code inside of the function (in this case, `print(\"Hello!\")`). In most programming languages, the system will decide whether to jump or replace based on which one is likely to be faster. Which of these the computer is actually doing in reality is not important to us, and either way of thinking is a perfectly valid way to figure out what the actual result of the code is going to be."
