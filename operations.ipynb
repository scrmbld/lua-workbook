For example, let's say you wanted to calculate how much [Jonathan the Seychelles giant tortoise ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_(tortoise)) would be on the moon. Jonathan weighs around 400 pounds on Earth, and the Moon has around 1/6 the gravity of Earth. So Jonathan would weigh 400*(1/6) pounds on the Moon. But what if we wanted to know how heavy [Harriet the Galapagos Tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_(tortoise)) would be on the moon? Right now, in order to solve this problem, it would be necessary to manually edit the code. This works, but is not great if we want our programs to be useable by other people. Since tortoises can vary in weight, but the Moon's gravity probably isn't going to change anytime soon, it would be really convenient if we could write a program that could calculate the wieght of *any* tortoise at 1/6 Earth's gravity. For more complicated problems, we might want to save a value computed in one part of our program so that we can use it in another. Variables can solve both of these problems.\n",

If a name hasn't been used yet, Lua will automatically make a new \"box\" for us and put our value inside. If the name has been used before, the value that's already inside the box will be replaced (or \"overwritten\") with the new one.\n",

Effectively, this just does division and rounds *down* (in other words, towards negative infinity). So, `13 // 4` will evaluate to 3, because 3.25 rounded down is 3. In fact `15 // 4` will also be rounded down to 3. This might seem confusing, since 3.75 is closer to 4 than to 3, but we aren't actually rounding, we're taking the floor. This is similar to rounding, but not the same. Note that `-13 // 4` and `-15 // 4` will both evaluate to -4 because -4 is lower than -3. Floor division is nice because the result is always a whole number (also called an integer).\n",

When performing division, there are a few options if the numbers don't divide into each other evenly. One is to continue into the decimal places (like the `/` operator). Another is to ignore the leftovers entirely (like the `//` operator). Finally, we can take the remainder. That is what the modulus operator does -- it gives us the remainder. The modulus operator *only* gives us the remainder. If we need the quotient, we can it using `//`.\n",

Then, we would subtract 18 from 19 ($19 - 18 = 1$). Since we cannot fit any more 3s into the remaining value of 1, we say that the our result is 6 with a remainder of 1. `19 // 3` would give us the 3, and `19 % 3` would give us the 1."
